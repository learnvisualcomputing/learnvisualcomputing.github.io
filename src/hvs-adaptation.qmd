# Visual Adaptations and Constancy {#sec-chpt-hvs-adaptations}

Humans adapt to all sorts of sensory input, including heat, pain, smell.
In all cases we care about two things: 1) the behavior after full adaptation and 2) the time course of adaptation.
Before this chapter is fully developed, check out our [lecture slides](https://cs.rochester.edu/courses/259/fall2025/decks/lect8-adaptation.pdf) on adaptation.

## Light Adaptation {#sec-chpt-hvs-adaptations-light}

light adaptation

## Dark Adaptation {#sec-chpt-hvs-adaptations-dark}

dark adaptation

## Chromatic Adaptation {#sec-chpt-hvs-adaptations-chroma}

chromatic adaptation, which is concerned with sensitivity scaling and is a direct result of light adaptation.

## Color Constancy {#sec-chpt-hvs-adaptations-cc}

color constancy goes beyond sensitivity scaling and involves higher-order visual functions, i.e., surface reflectance estimation.
